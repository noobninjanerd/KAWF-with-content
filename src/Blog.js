        <h2>Why Donate? </h2>
        <h4>Animal Rescue becomes a difficult task when there is passion in the work being done, but with no means of sustenance. This is the case in most animal rescue centers, especially in Kashmir. 
        Almost all centers are volunteer-based, non-profit organizations. Most of the animals they rescue are terribly injured, wrought with maggots, living in pathetic conditions without water or food. Can we even say that they are “living”, when the situation is so dire? 

        To fulfill these demands the centers need:
            food - at least twice a day for each animal at the shelter
            medications - which are expensive and scarcely in many areas of Kashmir, 
            special items - like baby formula for newborns, 
            ambulances for traveling to rescue the animals,
            space - for making a shelter, which they scarcely have, 
            the list is endless. 

        And the source of money? Their own pockets. 

        A major issue the animal centers face hence becomes the dire lack of funds. This stems from the lack of awareness in the region about the need and importance of Animal Rescue. 01

        Most centers resort to paying for the towering bills themselves. They get rescues, care for them in the best possible way, pay an immense amount, get more rescues and this cycle goes on till one day, they can’t do this anymore. 

        Donations are paramount for running animal rescue centers. 

        They need help, so they can help. So the maggot infested dog, the cat who got badly bitten, the horse that lost its leg, the pup who got abandoned, can all get the help they deserve.

        <h2>Our Goals</h2>
        <h4>Animals deserve as much help and support as humans do. We have some goals focused on this very thought. 
        
        A lifetime sanctuary for animals with permanent disabilites
        Fully operational diagnostic center and dispensary
        A surgical unit for immediate and on-going surgeries
        A mobile treatment unit for on-spot medical attention
        Ambulances
        Training programs for paravets and other non-technical staff
        Awareness programs in schools, colleges and offices
        Collaboration with print, digital and analogue media partners for running awareness and information programs
        Establishment of a quick response team for cases reported by locals
        A quick response helpline - experienced volunteers can give online support and guide people who want to help animals in need. 
        
        
        We seek to ultimately provide the animals in Kashmir with the same treatment and care as humans receive, but none of this will be possible without your help.

        <h2>Kashmir Animal Welfare Network & Partners</h2>
        <h4>KAWFCares works very hard to ensure that at least a few of the many animals in Kashmir receive timely help and treatment. Unfortunately, due to the escalating number of rescues we receive each day, and the lack of resources or people who can help us out, we might be a little delayed in responding to the rescue calls or messages from all of you out there who want to help. Nevertheless, we strive to respond back when we are free and so do leave a message - your name and contact, details or the rescue case - preferably with photos - and the exact location that we need to reach. 

        We will try our best to be as quick as possible in helping you out. 

        If we don’t respond as quickly as the situation desires, then feel free to contact our partners who are all very enthusiastically involved in animal rescues as well. You can contact them, and if they don’t respond either they are also probably busy. Leave a message with all the details as previously stated and stay strong.
